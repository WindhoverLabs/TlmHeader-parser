# tlm_cmd_merger

## Dependencies
`python>=3.5.2`
`PyYAML>=5.3.1`

Internal tool to write airliner's messages and commands to a sqlite database.

## How to install
This is meant to be a development package, so it is intended to be used inside a virtual environment managed by a tool like `venv `

1. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/cmd_msg_merger/tree/master
```
2. Start  a virtual environment by running 
```
python3 -m venv venv
``` 
3. Activate the virtual environment 
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install it
```
pip install -r requiremets.txt
```

5. Run it
```
python3 .src/tlm_cmd_merger.py [PATH_TO_YAML] [PATH_TO_SQLITE] 
```

**NOTE**: Beware that for now this is an internal tool written specifically for [airliner's](https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/airliner)  ground sysytem toolchain. The sqlite database is assumed to have been generated by [juicer](https://github.com/WindhoverLabs/juicer). The yaml file is assumed to have been generated by airliner. So this tool should *not* be executed by itself. As our toolchain evolves and improves.
